[00:10.52] You promised the world and I fell for it
[00:15.58] I put you first and you adored it
[00:18.43] Set fires to my forest
[00:21.13] And you let it burn
[00:22.44] Sang off-key on my chorus
[00:25.93] 'Cause it wasn't yours
[00:36.93] 
[00:29.20] I saw the signs and I ignored it, yeah
[00:34.30] Rose-colored glasses all distorted
[00:36.79] Set fire to my purpose
[00:39.76] But I let it burn
[00:41.46] You got off on the hurtin'
[00:44.03] When it wasn't yours
[00:54.03] 
[00:48.24] We'd always go into it blindly
[00:52.64] I needed to lose you to find me
[00:57.53] This dance, it was killing me softly
[01:02.28] I needed to hate you to love me, yeah
[01:20.78] 
[01:06.88] To love, love, yeah
[01:08.51] To love, love, yeah
[01:10.34] To love, yeah
[01:11.60] I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
[01:16.17] To love, love, yeah
[01:17.67] To love, love, yeah
[01:19.58] To love, yeah
[01:21.07] I needed to lose you to love me
[01:36.57] 
[01:25.34] I gave my all and they all know it
[01:29.60] You tore me down and now it's showing
[01:32.94] In two months you replaced us
[01:35.81] Like it was easy
[01:37.32] Made me think I deserved it
[01:40.23] In the thick of healing, yeah
[01:54.73] 
[01:44.24] We'd always go into it blindly
[01:48.64] I needed to lose you to find me
[01:53.31] This dance, it was killing me softly
[01:57.87] I needed to hate you to love me, yeah
[02:16.37] 
[02:02.78] To love, love, yeah
[02:04.56] To love, love, yeah
[02:06.30] To love, yeah
[02:07.38] I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
[02:11.55] To love, love, yeah
[02:13.69] To love, love, yeah
[02:15.35] To love, yeah
[02:16.82] I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
[02:35.32] 
[02:21.33] (To love, love, yeah)
[02:23.29] (To love, love, yeah)
[02:24.67] (To love, yeah)
[02:26.44] And now the chapter is closed and done
[02:30.86] (To love, love, yeah)
[02:32.56] (To love, love, yeah)
[02:34.24] (To love, yeah)
[02:35.31] And now it's goodbye, it's goodbye for us
[02:55.81] 
[02:40.26] We'd always go into it blindly
[02:44.51] I needed to lose you to find me
[02:49.47] This dance, it was killing me softly
[02:53.84] I needed to hate you to love me, yeah
[03:12.34] 
[02:58.48] To love, love, yeah
[02:59.91] To love, love, yeah
[03:02.04] To love, yeah
[03:03.23] I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
[03:07.62] To love, love, yeah
[03:09.47] To love, love, yeah
[03:10.97] To love, yeah
[03:12.76] I needed to lose you to love me
[03:28.26]
